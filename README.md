### Background

AWS SaaS (Software as a Service) solutions play a pivotal role in delivering scalable and efficient cloud services to businesses worldwide. To optimize business strategies and enhance decision-making, it is critical to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) such as **sales**, **quantity sold**, **profit margins**, and **discounts** across different dimensions. The need for this analysis is rooted in the following:

#### 1. Dynamic Market Landscape
AWS SaaS operates in a highly competitive market with rapid technological advancements and varying customer demands. Understanding **overall trends** in sales, quantity, and profit is crucial for assessing business performance over time.

#### 2. Product Performance Insights
Each product within AWS SaaS caters to unique customer needs. Tracking **product-specific KPIs** allows the business to identify best-performing offerings and address underperforming ones.

#### 3. Regional and Industry Focus
With AWS SaaS being a global provider, **regional and industry-level trends** are essential to tailor strategies for specific markets and industries. These insights help in allocating resources efficiently and identifying new growth opportunities.

#### 4. Profitability Trends
